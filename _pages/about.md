Welcome! I'm Ellie Wilson, a 3rd-year PhD Student in Bioengineering at Temple University. My research investigates the impacts of lower-limb exoskeletons on gait with a focus on biomechanics and cognition. Currently, I am working on my pre-dissertaion project with Dr. Daniel Jacobs in the [Robotics in Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RISE) Lab](https://sites.temple.edu/rise/). Prior to starting my graduate career, I received my B.S. in Biomedical and Health Sciences Engineering from the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill in 2016.

When I'm not in the lab, you can usually find me at a coffee shop searching for the best oat milk latte in Philly. I love to collect house plants, have recently taken up rock climbing, and am a Carolina Basketball fanatic (go heels!). kombucha brewing or hanging out with my cat Menchi.
